# Car Builder Pattern Implementation

This project demonstrates the **Builder Design Pattern** in Java, with a focus on **Clean Code principles**.

## Overview

The Builder Pattern allows step-by-step construction of complex objects while keeping the object immutable and code clean.

This implementation uses a `Car` class with a nested `Builder` class to construct cars with different configurations (sports car, family car, etc.).
